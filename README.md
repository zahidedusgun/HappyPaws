- The foundational structure of the project has been successfully established with entity, common, and enum structures, and the initial stages of the project have been completed successfully. Particularly, the Identity Mechanism has been meticulously written in the Domain Area, and the User table has been activated, facilitating the integration of users into the system.

- Models necessary for authentication processes have been effectively created in the Model folder of the API, and these models have been implemented in the AuthController file. Additionally, FluentValidation has been added to the created models, ensuring that users adhere to specific rules when registering in the system. This is a crucial step for the security and data integrity of the system.

- The hashing process for passwords during user registration has been successfully completed. This is a critical security measure that enables users to integrate into the system securely.

- Furthermore, the JWT Token system, which provides tokens to users logging into the system, has been successfully implemented. This facilitates secure user authentication and makes it easier for users to access and use the system.
